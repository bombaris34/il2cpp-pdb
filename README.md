Unity il2cpp reverse engineer

## Features

* Complete DLL restore (except code), can be used to extract `MonoBehaviour` and `MonoScript`
* Supports ELF, ELF64, Mach-O, PE, NSO and WASM format
* Supports Unity 5.3 - 2022.2
* Supports generate IDA, Ghidra and Binary Ninja scripts to help them better analyze il2cpp files
* Supports generate structures header file
* Supports Android memory dumped `libil2cpp.so` file to bypass protection
* Support bypassing simple PE protection
* **Native PDB generation for x64 PE (`GameAssembly.dll`)** — see below

## Native PDB generation (this fork)

This fork adds [`il2cpp_pdbgen`](il2cpp_pdbgen/), a standalone Rust tool that turns
Il2CppDumper's output into a real Windows **PDB** that IDA (and other PDB consumers)
load instantly — replacing the slow in-IDA `ida_with_struct.py` script.

The generated `GameAssembly.pdb` contains:

* **Function names + boundaries** for every method (publics + globals)
* **Full struct/union types** from `il2cpp.h` with correct x64 layouts
* **Typed function prototypes** (each function wired to its signature)
* A GUID/age matching the binary's debug directory, so IDA **auto-loads** it

It is written from scratch (MSF container, TPI/DBI/GSI/PSI streams, a C struct
layout engine) — no compiler or linker required. Generation takes seconds.

### Setup

```powershell
# Build the tool and place it next to Il2CppDumper's output.
# Add -InstallRust to install Rust automatically if you don't have it.
.\setup.ps1            # or:  .\setup.ps1 -InstallRust
```

Once built, Il2CppDumper **automatically** generates `<binary>.pdb` next to the
selected binary whenever the target is an **x64 PE** (set `"GeneratePdb": false`
in `config.json` to disable). The selected `GameAssembly.dll` path is forwarded
directly to the generator.

You can also run it manually:

```
il2cpp_pdbgen <dir>                                   # dir with GameAssembly.dll, il2cpp.h, script.json
il2cpp_pdbgen <dll> <il2cpp.h> <script.json> [out.pdb]
```

Then open the binary in IDA — the `.pdb` beside it is picked up automatically.

## Usage

Run `Il2CppDumper.exe` and choose the il2cpp executable file and `global-metadata.dat` file, then enter the information as prompted

The program will then generate all the output files in current working directory

### Command-line

```
Il2CppDumper.exe <executable-file> <global-metadata> <output-directory>
```

### Outputs

#### DummyDll

Folder, containing all restored dll files

Use [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy), [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) or other .Net decompiler tools to view

Can be used to extract Unity `MonoBehaviour` and `MonoScript`, for [UtinyRipper](https://github.com/mafaca/UtinyRipper), [UABE](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?22675-Unity-Assets-Bundle-Extractor)

#### ida.py

For IDA

#### ida_with_struct.py

For IDA, read il2cpp.h file and apply structure information in IDA

#### il2cpp.h

structure information header file

#### ghidra.py

For Ghidra

#### Il2CppBinaryNinja

For BinaryNinja

#### ghidra_wasm.py

For Ghidra, work with [ghidra-wasm-plugin](https://github.com/nneonneo/ghidra-wasm-plugin)

#### script.json

For ida.py, ghidra.py and Il2CppBinaryNinja

#### stringliteral.json

Contains all stringLiteral information

### Configuration

All the configuration options are located in `config.json`

Available options:

* `DumpMethod`, `DumpField`, `DumpProperty`, `DumpAttribute`, `DumpFieldOffset`, `DumpMethodOffset`, `DumpTypeDefIndex`
  * Whether to output these information to dump.cs

* `GenerateDummyDll`, `GenerateScript`
  * Whether to generate these things

* `DummyDllAddToken`
  * Whether to add token in DummyDll

* `RequireAnyKey`
  * Whether to press any key to exit at the end

* `ForceIl2CppVersion`, `ForceVersion`
  * If `ForceIl2CppVersion` is `true`, the program will use the version number specified in `ForceVersion` to choose parser for il2cpp binaries (does not affect the choice of metadata parser). This may be useful on some older il2cpp version (e.g. the program may need to use v16 parser on il2cpp v20 (Android) binaries in order to work properly)

* `ForceDump`
  * Force files to be treated as dumped

* `NoRedirectedPointer`
  * Treat pointers in dumped files as unredirected, This option needs to be `true` for files dumped from some devices

## Common errors

#### `ERROR: Metadata file supplied is not valid metadata file.`  

Make sure you choose the correct file. Sometimes games may obfuscate this file for content protection purposes and so on. Deobfuscating of such files is beyond the scope of this program, so please **DO NOT** file an issue regarding to deobfuscating.

If your file is `libil2cpp.so` and you have a rooted Android phone, you can try my other project [Zygisk-Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Zygisk-Il2CppDumper), it can bypass this protection.

#### `ERROR: Can't use auto mode to process file, try manual mode.`

Please note that the executable file for the PC platform is `GameAssembly.dll` or `*Assembly.dll`

You can open a new issue and upload the file, I will try to solve.

#### `ERROR: This file may be protected.`

Il2CppDumper detected that the executable file has been protected, use `GameGuardian` to dump `libil2cpp.so` from the game memory, then use Il2CppDumper to load and follow the prompts, can bypass most protections.

If you have a rooted Android phone, you can try my other project [Zygisk-Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Zygisk-Il2CppDumper), it can bypass almost all protections.
